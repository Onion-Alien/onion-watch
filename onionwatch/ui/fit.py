"""Dialogs grow to fit their text instead of clipping it (the same as Onion Board's
soundboard/ui/fit.py): a translation is often longer than the English.

Qt only enforces a dialog's *minimum* size: word-wrapped labels (rich text, long
hints) get taller as the window gets narrower or as their text changes, but the
dialog doesn't grow with them, so the text ends up squashed under the buttons,
especially with Windows display scaling. An event filter on each of our dialogs
(fit.watch in its __init__) steps in when the dialog is shown, when its layout
changes (a label's text was set) and when it's resized: it asks the layout how
tall it needs to be at the current width (heightForWidth, which accounts for
wrapping) and grows the window to that, moving it up if it would run off the
bottom of the screen. A dialog already as tall as the screen gets wider instead,
so its text wraps less.

It never shrinks a dialog: whatever the user (or the code) sized it to is kept.
Message boxes and file dialogs size themselves and aren't watched.
