"""Onion Watch's engine: watch a screen or one window for pictures you picked (a
rare spawn's name plate, a queue-pop banner, a "YOU DIED") and say when one appears.

A screen is captured with Windows' Desktop Duplication (DXGI, over ctypes:
`DupGrabber`), which also sees fullscreen games; where that isn't available it
falls back to plain GDI (`Grabber`), which sees borderless and windowed games but
can come out black for exclusive-fullscreen ones (`Watcher.black` says so). A
window is captured on its own (onionwatch.windows.WindowGrabber), so it's still
seen while other windows cover it. Either way the picture is sampled at about
twice a working width of a few hundred pixels, then turned grey and averaged down
2x2. Each picture is shrunk by the same factor and found with normalised
cross-correlation (an FFT for the correlation, running sums for each window's
brightness and contrast), so a match scores the same whatever the game's
brightness and nothing is downloaded or installed. Transparent parts of a picture
are left out of the comparison (`match(..., mask)`), so a cut-out icon matches
whatever is behind it. A 1080p screen at the default size costs a few
milliseconds per check.

`Gate` decides when a score is a new appearance: it fires once when a picture shows
up, then waits for it to go away before it can fire again (and never sooner than
the trigger's cooldown), so a death screen that stays up for five seconds plays
its sound once.

Each trigger can name what it's looked for in: a screen (an index into
monitors()) or a window (`WindowRef`); the rest use the default. `Watcher` keeps
one capture per screen or window in use and grabs each every tick, so triggers
on two game windows and a second monitor all work at once.

A trigger can hold several pictures (up to MAX_PICTURES): every one is matched
each tick, its live score is the best of them, and any one of them reaching the
threshold counts as the trigger showing up. The pictures are shrunk once, when
they change or the capture's size does, never per tick.
