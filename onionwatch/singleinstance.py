"""Only one Onion Watch at a time.

A second copy would watch the same windows and ring every alarm twice, and
every extra launch used to leave two more pythonw.exe processes lying around. The
lock is a named mutex, which Windows frees automatically if the app crashes, so
a stale lock can't keep it from starting. The second launch asks the first to
come to the front over a local socket.
